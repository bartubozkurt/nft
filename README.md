# Hardhat Project

[OpenSea testnet demo](https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/mumbai/0xf63fa916703d10036c4231649aab5fb2db622481/1)


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
